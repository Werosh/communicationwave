## üîß Prerequisites

Before you begin, you need to install Node.js on your computer.

### Step 1: Install Node.js

1. **Visit the Node.js website**: Go to [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
2. **Download the LTS version**: Click the button that says "LTS" (Long Term Support) - this is the stable version
3. **Run the installer**:

   - **Windows**: Double-click the downloaded `.msi` file and follow the installation wizard
   - **Mac**: Double-click the downloaded `.pkg` file and follow the installation wizard
   - **Linux**: Follow instructions on the Node.js website for your distribution

4. **Verify installation**: Open your terminal/command prompt and type:

   ```bash
   node --version
   ```

   You should see a version number (e.g., `v20.11.0`)

   Then type:

   ```bash
   npm --version
   ```

   You should see a version number (e.g., `10.2.4`)

## üöÄ Initial Setup

### Step 1: Extract the Project Files

1. Extract the project zip file to a location on your computer
2. Remember the folder location (e.g., `C:\Projects\com-wave` or `/Users/YourName/Projects/com-wave`)

### Step 2: Open Terminal/Command Prompt

**Windows:**

- Press `Windows + R`
- Type `cmd` and press Enter
- OR right-click in the project folder while holding Shift and select "Open PowerShell window here"

**Mac:**

- Press `Command + Space`
- Type `Terminal` and press Enter
- Navigate to the project folder using: `cd /path/to/project`

**Linux:**

- Open your terminal application
- Navigate to the project folder using: `cd /path/to/project`

### Step 3: Navigate to Project Folder

In your terminal, type:

```bash
cd path/to/com-wave
```

Replace `path/to/com-wave` with the actual path where you extracted the files.

**Example:**

- Windows: `cd C:\Projects\com-wave`
- Mac/Linux: `cd /Users/YourName/Projects/com-wave`

### Step 4: Install Dependencies

This is the most important step! Type the following command and press Enter:

```bash
npm install
```

**What's happening?**

- This command downloads and installs all the necessary libraries and tools the website needs
- It will create a `node_modules` folder in your project
- This might take 2-5 minutes depending on your internet speed
- You'll see a lot of text scrolling - this is normal!

**Wait until you see:**

```
added XXX packages in XXs
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Your website has two main features that need configuration:

### 1. Contact Form (EmailJS Setup)

The contact form needs to be connected to an email service so you can receive messages from visitors.

   - Follow the connection wizard for your provider
   - **Save your Service ID** (looks like `service_abc123`)

3. **Create an Email Template**:

   - Click on "Email Templates" in the left menu
   - Click "Create New Template"
   - Copy and paste this template:

   **Subject:**

5. **Update the Contact Page**:
   - Open the file: `src/pages/Contact.jsx`
   - Find these lines (around line 24-26):
   ```javascript
   const serviceId = "YOUR_SERVICE_ID";
   const templateId = "YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID";
   const publicKey = "YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY";
   ```
   - Replace with your actual IDs:
   ```javascript
   const serviceId = "service_abc123";
   const templateId = "template_xyz789";
   const publicKey = "abcdefg1234567";
   ```
   - Save the file

### 2. PayPal Integration (Optional)

   - Log in or create a developer account
   - Go to "My Apps & Credentials"
   - Under "REST API apps", create a new app
   - Copy your **Client ID**

2. **Update Workshops Page**:
   - Open the file: `src/pages/Workshops.jsx`
   - Find this line (around line 14):
   ```javascript
   initialOptions={{ clientId: "YOUR_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID" }}
   ```
   - Replace with your Client ID:
   ```javascript
   initialOptions={{ clientId: "YOUR_ACTUAL_CLIENT_ID" }}
   ```
   - Save the file

**Note:** For testing, you can use PayPal's sandbox client ID.

## üíª Running Locally

Now that everything is set up, let's run your website!

### Start the Development Server

In your terminal (make sure you're in the project folder), type:

```bash
npm run dev
```

**You should see:**

```
  VITE v7.x.x  ready in XXX ms

  ‚ûú  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ‚ûú  Network: use --host to expose
```

### View Your Website

1. Open your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
2. Go to: `http://localhost:5173`
3. Your website should now be running! üéâ

### Making Changes

- Any changes you make to the code will automatically update in the browser
- No need to refresh manually!

### Stopping the Server

- Press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal
- Type `Y` if asked to confirm

## üèóÔ∏è Building for Production

Before deploying your website, you need to create a production-ready build.

### Create Production Build

In your terminal, type:

```bash
npm run build
```

**What's happening?**

- Your website is being optimized for production
- Files are being compressed and minified
- A new `dist` folder is created with your production files

**You should see:**

```
‚úì built in XXXs
```

The `dist` folder now contains your complete website ready for deployment!

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. `npm install` not working

**Error**: `npm: command not found`

- **Solution**: Node.js is not installed. Go back to [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)

**Error**: `permission denied` or `EACCES`

- **Solution**:
  - **Mac/Linux**: Try `sudo npm install`
  - **Windows**: Run command prompt as Administrator

#### 2. Website not loading at localhost:5173

**Issue**: Port already in use

- **Solution**:
  - Close any other programs using that port
  - OR use a different port: `npm run dev -- --port 3000`

#### 3. Contact form not sending emails

**Check these:**

- Are your EmailJS Service ID, Template ID, and Public Key correct?
- Did you verify your email in EmailJS?
- Check the browser console (press F12) for error messages

#### 4. PayPal button not showing

**Check these:**

- Is your PayPal Client ID correct?
- Are you using the right client ID (sandbox vs production)?

#### 5. Build fails with errors

**Solution**:

- Delete `node_modules` folder
- Delete `package-lock.json` file
- Run `npm install` again
- Run `npm run build` again

#### 6. Website works locally but not after deployment

**Check these:**

- Did you upload the files from the `dist` folder (not the entire project)?
- Did you configure redirects properly (for single-page apps)?
- Check your hosting platform's documentation for React apps

#### 7. Changes not showing up

**Solution**:

- Clear your browser cache (Ctrl + Shift + Delete)
- Hard refresh (Ctrl + Shift + R or Cmd + Shift + R)
- Try in an incognito/private window

- **Workshops**: `src/pages/Workshops.jsx`

Just open the file in any text editor and modify the text!

### Changing Images

1. Add your images to `src/assets/`
2. Import them in your component:
   ```javascript
   import myImage from "./assets/myImage.jpg";
   ```
3. Use them:
   ```javascript
   <img src={myImage} alt="Description" />
   ```

### Adding New Pages

1. Create a new file in `src/pages/` (e.g., `NewPage.jsx`)
2. Copy the structure from an existing page
3. Add the route in `src/App.jsx`:
   ```javascript
   <Route path="/new-page" element={<NewPage />} />
   ```
