## 4. ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### EmailJS Setup (Contact Form)

The contact form requires EmailJS configuration to send emails. Without this, the contact form will not work.

üìÑ **Detailed Instructions**: See the complete setup guide in the `EMAILJS_SETUP.md` file included with this project.

**Quick Overview:**

1. Create a free account at [EmailJS.com](https://www.emailjs.com/)
2. Set up an email service (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
3. Create an email template
4. Get your Service ID, Template ID, and Public Key
5. Update `src/pages/Contact.jsx` with your credentials (lines 24-26):

```javascript
const serviceId = "YOUR_SERVICE_ID"; // Replace with your Service ID
const templateId = "YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID"; // Replace with your Template ID
const publicKey = "YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY"; // Replace with your Public Key
```

**Free Tier Limits**: 200 emails per month

### PayPal Integration (Optional)

If you want to enable PayPal payments for workshops:

1. Create a PayPal Business account at [paypal.com](https://www.paypal.com/)
2. Get your PayPal Client ID from the Developer Dashboard
3. Update the PayPal configuration in your workshop-related pages

> **Note**: The project currently uses a sandbox/test mode. For production, you'll need to replace test credentials with live credentials.

### Environment Variables

This project does not currently use a `.env` file. All configuration is done directly in the source code files mentioned above.

---

## 5. üíª Development

### Running the Development Server

Start the local development server to preview your site:

```bash
npm run dev
```

**What to expect:**

- The terminal will display a message like:

  ```
  VITE v7.1.7  ready in 500 ms

  ‚ûú  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ‚ûú  Network: use --host to expose
  ```

- Open your web browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:5173/`
- You should see the Communication Wave website homepage

### Development Features

- **Hot Reload**: Changes to your code automatically refresh the browser
- **Fast**: Vite provides instant updates when you save files
- **Error Display**: Errors show up both in the terminal and in the browser

### Verifying Everything Works

‚úÖ **Checklist**:

- [ ] Homepage loads correctly
- [ ] Navigation menu works (click different links)
- [ ] All pages are accessible (Home, About, Services, Contact, etc.)
- [ ] Contact form displays (functionality requires EmailJS setup)
- [ ] No errors in the browser console (press F12 to open developer tools)

### Stopping the Server

To stop the development server:

- Press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal
- Type `y` if prompted to confirm

## 6. üèóÔ∏è Building for Production

Before deploying your website, you need to create an optimized production build.

### Build Command

```bash
npm run build
```

**What this does**:

- Optimizes all your code for faster loading
- Minifies JavaScript and CSS files
- Compresses images and assets
- Creates a `dist` folder with all production-ready files

**Expected output**:

```
vite v7.1.7 building for production...
‚úì 1234 modules transformed.
dist/index.html                    1.23 kB
dist/assets/index-a1b2c3d4.js      145.67 kB ‚îÇ gzip: 45.23 kB
dist/assets/index-e5f6g7h8.css     23.45 kB ‚îÇ gzip: 6.78 kB
‚úì built in 5.42s
```

### Testing the Production Build Locally

Before deploying, test that the production build works correctly:

```bash
npm run preview
```

This starts a local server serving your production build (usually at `http://localhost:4173/`).

**Verify**:

- [ ] All pages load correctly
- [ ] Navigation works
- [ ] Images and styles appear correctly
- [ ] No console errors

## 9. üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Build Errors

#### Error: "node: command not found"

**Solution**: Node.js is not installed or not in your PATH

- Install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
- Restart your terminal after installation

#### Error: "npm: command not found"

**Solution**: npm is not installed (should come with Node.js)

- Reinstall Node.js
- Verify installation: `node --version` and `npm --version`

#### Error: "Module not found" or "Cannot find module"

**Solution**: Dependencies not installed

```bash
npm install
```

#### Error: "Port 5173 is already in use"

**Solution**: Another process is using the default port

- Stop the other process, or
- Use a different port: `npm run dev -- --port 3000`

### Development Server Issues

#### Site Not Loading at localhost:5173

**Solutions**:

1. Check if the dev server is actually running (look for errors in terminal)
2. Try a different port: `npm run dev -- --port 3001`
3. Check firewall settings
4. Try accessing `127.0.0.1:5173` instead of `localhost:5173`

#### Changes Not Reflecting in Browser

**Solutions**:

1. Hard refresh: `Ctrl+F5` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
2. Check terminal for errors that stopped the server
3. Clear browser cache
4. Restart the dev server (`Ctrl+C` then `npm run dev`)

### Deployment Issues

#### Build Fails on Hosting Platform

**Solutions**:

1. Check build logs for specific errors
2. Ensure Node.js version matches (use `.nvmrc` file or platform settings)
3. Verify `package.json` has correct scripts
4. Test build locally first: `npm run build`

#### Environment Variables Not Working

**Solution**: This project doesn't use environment variables by default. Configuration is in source files (like `Contact.jsx` for EmailJS). If you need environment variables:

1. Create a `.env` file in project root
2. Add variables with `VITE_` prefix:
   ```
   VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_service_id
   ```
3. Access in code: `import.meta.env.VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID`
4. Configure variables in your hosting platform's settings

### Finding Logs and Error Messages

#### Local Development

- **Terminal**: Errors appear in the terminal where you ran `npm run dev`
- **Browser Console**: Press `F12` ‚Üí Console tab

#### Production (Deployed)

- **Netlify**: Site dashboard ‚Üí Deploys ‚Üí Click on deployment ‚Üí View logs
- **Vercel**: Project dashboard ‚Üí Deployments ‚Üí Click deployment ‚Üí View logs
- **Browser**: Always check browser console (F12) on the live site
